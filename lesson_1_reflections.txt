How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it make every thing easy and it's a simple way to do that

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    because I will see all bugs and errors that i make in the pervious version 
    and I will learn not to do them again 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros : the commits will be more usful and logical.
    cons : maybe sometimes if we forget to commit and suddenly something wrong happend 
           then I will lose my changes. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think it depends on the kind of the files that version control system saving or dealing with.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    The tow commends working togather 
    we use git log to see all commits and we use git diff to compare the commits that we want 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    when I know that my project is in safe and  makeing changes will not cause any problems  
    and if I make any mistake then I can fix that ,then diffently I will be super confident

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I have a project for the master and I want to make changes in the source code for an poen source app.
