When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	I think it is necessary to use the remote repo. from time to time, that will keep my work in safe.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I think the files on GitHub will be in safe all the time so when i need somthing to pull i will do that manually,
	there is no need to do that automaticlly.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	fork : when we need to clone a repository exist on GitHub to our profile on GitHub too.

	clones : when we need to make a copy of a repository from GitHub to our local or a copy from our local to anthor point in the local.

	branch : when we need to do changes on our porject like make a new feature or fix bug.
